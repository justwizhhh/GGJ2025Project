A cozy candy-themed 3D collectathon! Octo the Octopus is on a mission to collect all of the tapioca balls in the ocean, and create the world's biggest boba tea! Find all of the tapioca in the level without losing your health, and fend off against other vicious wildlife.

Made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2025 (UWE Bristol GGJ24), with the theme: "Bubble". This is the archived source code for the final submitted build, as well as the post-jam build (which does not exist yet).
